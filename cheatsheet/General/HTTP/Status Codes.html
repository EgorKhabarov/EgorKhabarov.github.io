<h3>100 Continue</h3>
<p>This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue the request, or ignore the response if the request is already finished</p>
<h3>101 Switching Protocol</h3>
<p>This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client, and indicates the protocol the server is switching to</p>
<h3>102 Processing</h3>
<p>This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet</p>
<h3>103 Early Hints</h3>
<p>This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response</p>

</ul>
<h3>200 OK</h3>
<p>The request has succeeded
The meaning of success depends on the HTTP method:
• GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body
• HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body
• PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body
• TRACE The message body contains the request message as received by the server</p>
<h3>201 Created</h3>
<p>The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result
This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or same FUT requests</p>
<h3>202 Accepted</h3>
<p>The request has been received but not yet acted upon
It is noncommittal since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request
It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing</p>
<h3>203 Non-Authoritative information</h3>
<p>This response code means the returned meta information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin servet, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy
This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource
Except for that specific case, the "200 OK" response is preferred to this status</p>
<h3>204 No Content</h3>
<p>There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful
The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones</p>
<h3>205 Reset Content</h3>
<p>Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request</p>
<h3>206 Partial Content</h3>
<p>This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource</p>
<h3>207 Multi-Status</h3>
<p>Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate</p>
<h3>208 Already Reported</h3>
<p>Used inside a response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection</p>
<h3>226 IM Used</h3>
<p>The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance manipulations applied to the current instance</p>

<h3>300 Multiple Choice</h3>
<p>The request has more than oné possible response
The user-agent or user should choose one of them
There is no standardized way of choosing one of the responses, but HTML links to the possibilities are recommended so the user can pick</p>
<h3>301 Moved Permanently</h3>
<p>The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently
The new URL is given in the response</p>
<h3>302 Found</h3>
<p>This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily
Further changes in the URI might be made in the future
Therefore, this same URi should be used by the client in future requests</p>
<h3>303 See Other</h3>
<p>The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request</p>
<h3>304 Not Modified</h3>
<p>This is used for caching purposes it tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response,</p>
<h3>305 Use Proxy</h3>
<p>Defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy it has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band configuration ol a proxy</p>
<h3>306 Unused</h3>
<p>This response code is no longer used, it is just reserved
It was used in a previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification</p>
<h3>307 Temporary Redirect</h3>
<p>The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method that was used in the prior request
This has the same semantics as the 302 Found HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used if a POST was used in the first request a POST must be used in the second request</p>
<h3>308 Permanent Redirect</h3>
<p>This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the Location: HTTP Response header
This has the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used:
if a POST was used in the fist request, a POST must be used in the second request</p>

<h3>400 Bad Request</h3>
<p>The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax</p>
<h3>401 Unauthorized</h3>
<p>Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated"
That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response</p>
<h3>402 Payment Required</h3>
<p>This response code is reserved for future use
The initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this status code is used very rarely and no standard convention exists</p>
<h3>403 Forbidden</h3>
<p>The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource
Unlike 401 the client's identity is known to the server</p>
<h3>404 Not Found</h3>
<p>The server can not find the requested resource
In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized
In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist
Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client
This response code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurrence on the web
The resource could not be found
This is often used as a catch-all for all Invalid URis requested of the server</p>
<h3>405 Method Not Allowed</h3>
<p>The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used
For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource
The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this error code</p>
<h3>406 Not Acceptable</h3>
<p>This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent</p>
<h3>407 Proxy Authentication Required</h3>
<p>This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy</p>
<h3>408 Request Timeout</h3>
<p>This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client
It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection
This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, or IE9, use HTTP pre connection mechanisms to speed up surfing
Also, note that some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message</p>
<h3>409 Conflict</h3>
<p>This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server</p>
<h3>410 Gone</h3>
<p>This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from the server, with no forwarding address
Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource
The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for "limited-time, promotional services"
APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code</p>
<h3>411 Length Required</h3>
<p>Server rejected the request because the Content-Length header field is not defined and the server requires it</p>
<h3>412 Precondition Failed</h3>
<p>The client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet</p>
<h3>413 Payload Too Large</h3>
<p>Request entity is larger than limits defined by server
the server might close the connection or return an Retry-After header field</p>
<h3>414 URI Too Long</h3>
<p>The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret</p>
<h3>415 Unsupported Media Type</h3>
<p>The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request</p>
<h3>416 Range Not Satisfiable</h3>
<p>The range specified by the Range header field In the request can't be fullfilled
it's possible that the range is outside the size of the target URI's data</p>
<h3>417 Expectation Failed</h3>
<p>This response code means the expectation indicated by the Expect request header field can't be met by the server</p>
<h3>418 I'm a Teapot</h3>
<p>Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot"
The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout</p>
<h3>421 Misdirected Request</h3>
<p>The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response
This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses
for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI</p>
<h3>422 Unprocessable Entity</h3>
<p>The request was formatted correctly but cannot be processed in its current form
Often used when the specified parameters fail validation errors</p>
<h3>423 Locked</h3>
<p>The requested resource was found but has been locked and will not be returned</p>
<h3>424 Failed Dependency</h3>
<p>The request failed due to a failure of a previous request</p>
<h3>425 Too Early</h3>
<p>Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed</p>
<h3>426 Upgrade Required</h3>
<p>The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol
but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol
The server sends an Upgrade header in a 426 response to indicate the required protocol(s)</p>
<h3>428 Precondition Required</h3>
<p>The origin server requires the request to be conditional
This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem,
where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server,
when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict</p>
<h3>429 Too Many Requests</h3>
<p>The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting")</p>
<h3>431 Request Header Fields Too Large</h3>
<p>The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large
The request may be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields</p>
<h3>440 Login Timout</h3>
<p>A Microsoft extension. Indicates that your session has expired</p>
<h3>444 No Response</h3>
<p>Used in Nginx logs to indicate that the server has returned
no information to the client and closed the connection (useful as a deterrent for malware)</p>
<h3>449 Retry With</h3>
<p>A Microsoft extension. The request should be retried after performing the appropriate action</p>
<h3>450 Blocked By Windows Parental Controls</h3>
<p>A Microsoft extension, This error is given when Windows Parental Controls
are turned on and are blocking access to the given webpage</p>
<h3>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h3>
<p>A server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource
or to a set of resources that Includes the requested resource</p>
<h3>451 Redirect</h3>
<p>Used in Exchange ActiveSync if there either is a more efficient server
to use or the server cannot access the users mailbox</p>
<h3>495 Cert Error</h3>
<p>Nginx internal code used when SSL client certificate error occurred
to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection</p>
<h3>496 No Cert</h3>
<p>Nginx internal code used when client didn't provide certificate
to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection</p>
<h3>497 HTTP to HTTPS</h3>
<p>Nginx internal code used for the plain HTTP requests that are sent to HTTPS port
to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection</p>
<h3>498 Token Expired/Invalid</h3>
<p>Returned by ArcGIS for Server. A code of 498 indicates an expired or otherwise invalid token</p>
<h3>499 Client Closed Request</h3>
<p>Used in Nginx logs to indicate when the connection has been closed by client
while the server is still processing its request, making server unable to send a status code back</p>
<h3>499 Token Required</h3>
<p>Returned by ArcGIS for Server. A code of 499 indicates that a token is required (if no token was submitted)</p>
